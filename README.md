# Comprehensive Data Analysis

## Overview

This repository contains a comprehensive data analysis of datasets related to economics, healthcare, and crime. The analysis is performed using Python and various libraries such as pandas, matplotlib, seaborn, and plotly. The results are presented in a detailed work report, and the code for generating visualizations is provided in a Jupyter Notebook.

## Contents

1. **Jupyter Notebook: [Comprehensive_Data_Analysis.ipynb](Comprehensive_Data_Analysis.ipynb)**

   - Detailed step-by-step analysis of the datasets.
   - Code snippets for data loading, exploration, and visualization.
   - Visualizations include line plots, bar plots, density plots, box plots, violin plots, 3D scatter plots, waffle charts, choropleth maps, and more.

2. **Datasets:**

   - The datasets used for analysis are located in the "s1dataset" folder.
     - economics.csv
     - healthcare_census.csv
     - Annual_Crime_Dataset_2015.csv

3. **HTML Output: [interactive_sankey.html](interactive_sankey.html)**
   - An interactive Sankey diagram showcasing the flow of offenses in different council districts.

## How to Use

1. **Jupyter Notebook:**

   - Open the Jupyter Notebook in a compatible environment (Jupyter, JupyterLab).
   - Run each cell sequentially to reproduce the analysis and visualizations.

2. **HTML Output:**
   - Open the [interactive_sankey.html](interactive_sankey.html) file in a web browser to interact with the dynamic Sankey diagram.

## Dependencies

Ensure you have the following Python libraries installed:

```bash
pip install pandas matplotlib seaborn plotly geopandas squarify wordcloud pywaffle
```

For the Sankey diagram, additional installations are required:

```bash
pip install matplotlib mpl_sankey
```
